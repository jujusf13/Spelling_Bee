WORKS
- Retreive word works, but it happens when the page is open, not when start button is clicked
- Text to speech of first word works, not sure about after


TO DO
- give player instructions
- play game method
- - If true continue -> get new word
- - If false end game, worry about starting a new game later on and holding on to the score.
- Backend


Notes
- fetch function is commented out right now to stop calling the api
